# outdated-ps99-macro-builder
Uses AHK Python wrapper and CV to find specific images and click on them, uses RAM (Roblox Account Manager) to launch accounts via their API, custom CV "implemetion",  all written in python, very outdated macro - made in February.

# needed stuff:
all the python library used 
ram (roblox account manager)

# the macros don't work anymore, but the pid collection + ram remote account launching + find images on screen(resultion doesn't matter) works perfectly, if needed you can use them to create a new macro.
